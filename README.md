# EMF Detector Project (ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘» Ghost Hunter ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»)

This project involves the design and construction of an Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector using various electronic components. The device aims to detect EMF levels and provide both a visual and numerical display of the detected values. It uses an ESP32-C6 microcontroller, a 4-digit 7-segment display, LEDs, and other components to create an affordable, portable EMF detection solution.

## Project Overview

The EMF Detector will:
- Detect electromagnetic fields using an external sensor wand.
- Display EMF readings on a **4-digit 7-segment display**.
- Use **10 LEDs** to provide a bar-graph-style visual indicator of EMF strength.
- Include two **potentiometers** for sensitivity adjustments.
- Be powered by a **5-cell AA NiMH battery pack** for extended battery life and rechargeable convenience.

## Hardware Components

### Main Components
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32-C6
- **EMF Sensor Wand:** Detects electromagnetic fields with adjustable sensitivity.
- **Display:** LTC-4627JR 4-digit 7-segment display for numeric EMF values.
- **LED Bar:** 10 LEDs to indicate EMF intensity visually.
- **Potentiometers:** Dual potentiometers (500kÎ© stereo linear) for sensitivity control.
- **Power Source:** 5 AA NiMH batteries in series (6V nominal) with voltage regulation for the ESP32-C6 and display components.

### Other Key Components
- **Right-Angle 3.5mm Stereo Audio Jack:** For external connections.
- **SPDT Toggle Switch (Locking):** Used for turning the device on/off.
- **9V Battery Holder:** Initially considered but replaced with AA NiMH cells.
- **JTAG Header:** For programming and debugging the ESP32-C6.

## Design Notes

- **Power Regulation:** A voltage regulator will step down the 6V from the NiMH battery pack to the required 3.3V for the ESP32-C6 and other components.
- **Mounting:** Components like the potentiometers and 3.5mm audio jack will be mounted on a custom PCB designed in KiCad.
- **Right-Angle Components:** Right-angle potentiometers and audio jacks have been chosen to facilitate easy adjustment and connection within the deviceâ€™s enclosure.

## Usage

1. **Power On:** Use the locking SPDT toggle switch to power the device.
2. **Adjust Sensitivity:** Use the dual potentiometers to fine-tune the EMF detection sensitivity.
3. **Read EMF Levels:** The 7-segment display shows numerical values, while the LED bar provides a quick visual indication of EMF intensity.
4. **External Connections:** Use the 3.5mm audio jack for external interfaces if needed.

## Project Status

- **Current Stage:** Hardware design and component selection phase.
- **Next Steps:** Complete the KiCad PCB design, assemble components, and begin firmware development for the ESP32-C6.
