# EMF Detector Project (ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘» Ghost Hunter ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»)

This project involves the design and construction of an Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector using various electronic components. The device aims to detect EMF levels and provide both a visual and numerical display of the detected values. It uses an ESP32-C6 microcontroller, a 4-digit 7-segment display, LEDs, and other components to create an affordable, portable EMF detection solution.

## Project Overview

The EMF Detector will:
- Detect electromagnetic fields using a **Hall effect sensor** mounted directly on the PCB.
- Display EMF readings on a **4-digit 7-segment display** controlled by the MAX7219 display driver.
- Use **10 LEDs** to provide a bar-graph-style visual indicator of EMF strength.
- Include two **potentiometers** for sensitivity adjustments.
- Be powered by a **5-cell AA NiMH battery pack** for extended battery life and rechargeable convenience.
- Incorporate a **3.5mm stereo audio jack** to listen to EMF level changes in real-time.

## Hardware Components

### Main Components
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32-C6 WiFi 6 + BLE 5.3 Module.
- **EMF Sensor:** DRV5053RAQLPG Hall Effect Sensor for detecting electromagnetic fields, mounted on the PCB.
- **Display:** **TDCR1060M** 4-digit 7-segment display, driven by the MAX7219CWG+T for numeric EMF values.
- **LED Bar:** 10 LEDs to indicate EMF intensity visually, connected to the ESP32-C6 GPIO pins.
- **Potentiometers:** Dual potentiometers (500kÎ© stereo linear) for sensitivity control.
- **Power Source:** 5 AA NiMH batteries in series (6V nominal) with a low-dropout voltage regulator (LDLN050) to step down to 3.3V for the ESP32-C6 and display components.
- **USB-C Port:** Allows for an external power supply and potential data communication.
- **Stereo Audio Jack (3.5mm):** Enables audio output to listen to EMF levels, providing an auditory indication of electromagnetic field strength.

### Other Key Components
- **SPDT Toggle Switch (Locking):** Used for turning the device on/off.
- **JTAG Pads (TC2030-MCP):** For programming and debugging the ESP32-C6.
- **Inductors:** 100mH radial inductor for filtering and noise suppression.
- **Capacitors:** Various capacitors (e.g., 2.2ÂµF, 1ÂµF, 22ÂµF) for noise filtering and stability in the power supply.
- **Diodes:** Includes ESD protection diodes (e.g., SD03) for USB-C and other sensitive components.

## Design Notes

- **Power Regulation:** The 6V from the NiMH battery pack is regulated to 3.3V using an LDO regulator (LDLN050) to power the ESP32-C6, display, and other components.
- **EMF Sensor:** The DRV5053RAQLPG Hall Effect Sensor, mounted on the PCB, provides an analog output, which is read by the ESP32-C6's ADC pin to measure electromagnetic fields.
- **Display Driver:** The MAX7219CWG+T drives the **TDCR1060M** 4-digit 7-segment display to show numeric values of detected EMF strength.
- **LED Indicators:** The 10 LEDs connected to GPIO pins on the ESP32-C6 act as a visual bar-graph, indicating the intensity of the detected electromagnetic field.
- **Audio Output:** The 3.5mm stereo audio jack provides an auditory signal to monitor EMF changes, with the output modulated according to the detected EMF levels.
- **Mounting:** Right-angle components (e.g., potentiometers and audio jacks) facilitate easy adjustment and connection within the deviceâ€™s enclosure.

## Connections Overview

### Key Connections to the ESP32-C6
- **EMF Sensor:** The output of the DRV5053RAQLPG is connected to an ADC pin (ADC1_CH0) on the ESP32-C6.
- **7-Segment Display:** Controlled by the MAX7219 using DIN, LOAD, and CLK pins.
- **LEDs:** Connected to various GPIOs (GPIO3 - GPIO16) for individual control.
- **Stereo Audio Jack:** Connected to an appropriate GPIO pin and configured to output PWM or digital signal to modulate the audio based on EMF levels.
- **JTAG Header:** For programming and debugging, using the TXD0 and RXD0 pins.
- **USB-C Port:** Provides power to the circuit and ESD protection for the input.

## Usage

1. **Power On:** Use the locking SPDT toggle switch to power the device.
2. **Adjust Sensitivity:** Use the dual potentiometers to fine-tune the EMF detection sensitivity.
3. **Read EMF Levels:** The **TDCR1060M** 7-segment display shows numerical values, while the LED bar provides a quick visual indication of EMF intensity.
4. **Listen to EMF Levels:** Use the 3.5mm stereo audio jack to listen to the variations in EMF strength.

## Project Status

- **Current Stage:** Hardware design phase is nearing completion, with all main components selected and integrated into the KiCad schematic.
- **Next Steps:** Complete PCB layout in KiCad, order components, assemble the PCB, and begin firmware development for the ESP32-C6 to handle EMF detection, display updates, and audio output.
